# RGV-FAWC-AI-Chatbot

This project was done for CSCI 3351 AI-Powered Apps With Mr. Eric Martinez
Created using Python3, Gradio, OPENAI API, and SQLite databases
This AI Chatbot named Sparky simulates an app that allows users to sign up for cleanup events using databases and prompt engineering

*This file requires a .env file with an OpenAI_Base and OpenAI_key in order to work. May need updated versions of dependency software as well, so it does not currently work
(Never put your API base or key directly in the public repo)
